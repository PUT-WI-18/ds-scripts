Decission Support task solving scripts

## What and where
Everyone is encouraged to pickup and and solve issues from issues board. Just remember to drop some note how to use your code, and give some meaningful example. Each solver ought to be in separated directory. Language of choice is Python 3.6.8+ as of neatness and setup simplicity. Each dependency / additional package should be placed in main `requirements.txt` file.

## How to use
1. Install needed packages. e.g.  
```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
2. Run scripts!

## How to freeze dependencies
```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
**Important:** Please don't drop all your deps if you are not using any kind of Python virtual environment. Otherwise you freeze all dependencies installed so far for your python instance, which trust or not is chunky piece of binaries
