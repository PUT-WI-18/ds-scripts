# Description
Solvers for rough Set Theory. There are two different solvers, each with different convenience and ease of use.

# Solvers
- **Antollo Solver** - simpler, but without rule derivation. Some concerns about corectness are also in place. Use at your own risk. Sample input in source code.
- **IDSS Solver / ROSE 2** - complex solver created as PUT project. Works well but some practice is needed. End user manual reveals after install. More info on IDSS [site](http://idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/site/60.html).



### tl;dr
Antollo solver is also available as online solution [here](https://ideone.com/rifAgJ)
